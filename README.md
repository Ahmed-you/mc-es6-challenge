# Morning challenge: Convert ES6 code to ES5 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your computer.

2. Run `node assertEquals.js` from the repository directory to run the tests in Node.

## Description (based on a true story)

As part of a job application, an employer has asked you to write an `assertEquals` function as a coding test. You're desperate to impress them, so you use as many ES6 features as you can – arrow functions, spread operators, classes, and more.

Just before submitting your test, you double check the brief and realise that your function needs to run in Internet Explorer – which doesn't support ES6! With an hour to go until your deadline, you need to replace as many of the ES6 features as possible with their ES5 equivalents.

## Instructions



## Morals of the story
Never assume that your code will run in an environment that supports ES6 syntax. And always read the brief properly.
